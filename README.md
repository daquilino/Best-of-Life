/*Yelp search query is sorted by 'rating' in which "The rating sort is not strictly sorted by 
the rating value, but by an adjusted rating value that takes into account the number of 
ratings, similar to a bayesian average. This is so a business with 1 rating of 5 stars 
doesnâ€™t immediately jump to the top.".
